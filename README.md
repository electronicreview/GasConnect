# GasConnect (v1.0)

![Logo](src/assets/logo.png)

## DESCRIPTION <br>
Finding the best deal for gas in different locations is a challenge, with different companies offering gas at different prices. Refilling a car in a new location becomes more challenging since one may not have experience of the location, thus making it a challenge worth looking into. The app idea was developed to solve the problem of getting cheap gas deals, finding reputable gas stations in new locations, and getting updates on gas availability in each gas station
